    {
      "question": "During the simulation, how did you identify an SSH brute force attack?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By recognizing multiple failed login attempts from various IP addresses within a short time frame",
        "b": "By noticing a sudden drop in network traffic",
        "c": "By observing unusual file changes on the server",
        "d": "By detecting encrypted packets in the network"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. SSH brute force attacks are identified by a high number of failed login attempts from different IP addresses within a short period. More details <a href='https://www.example.com/ssh-brute-force'>here</a>.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A sudden drop in traffic is not typically associated with brute force attacks.",
        "c": "Incorrect. File changes are not a direct indicator of SSH brute force attacks.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Encrypted packets are not a specific indicator of brute force attacks."

      "question": "What role did Snort play in detecting malicious activity during the lab exercise?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Snort generated alerts and logged suspicious traffic patterns",
        "b": "Snort blocked all incoming network traffic",
        "c": "Snort encrypted all network communications",
        "d": "Snort performed regular system backups"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Snort's role was to generate alerts and log traffic patterns indicative of malicious activity, such as SSH brute force attacks. Learn more <a href='https://www.example.com/snort-roles'>here</a>.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Snort does not block traffic; it only monitors and alerts.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Snort does not handle encryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Snort is not responsible for system backups."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What key feature of Snort allows it to detect patterns such as SSH brute force attacks?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Signature-based rules",
        "b": "Packet filtering",
        "c": "System resource monitoring",
        "d": "User authentication"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Snort uses signature-based rules to detect specific patterns of network traffic that match known attack signatures, including those for SSH brute force attacks. More information <a href='https://www.example.com/snort-signatures'>here</a>.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Snort is not primarily a packet filtering tool.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Snort does not monitor system resources.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Snort is not involved in user authentication."
