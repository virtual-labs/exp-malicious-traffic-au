<h2>Theory</h2>
<p><b>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</b></p>
<p> A framework designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats, alerting system administrators to potential security breaches.</p>
<p><b>Working of Intrusion Detection System(IDS)</b></p>
<li>An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors the traffic on a computer network to detect any suspicious activity.</li>
<li>It analyzes the data flowing through the network to look for patterns and signs of abnormal behavior.</li>
<li>The IDS compares the network activity to a set of predefined rules and patterns to identify any activity that might indicate an attack or intrusion.</li>
<li>If the IDS detects something that matches one of these rules or patterns, it sends an alert to the system administrator.</li>
<li>The system administrator can then investigate the alert and take action to prevent any damage or further intrusion.</li>
<br/>

<p><b>Pattern Recognition in Network Security:</b> Understanding the typical patterns of benign traffic (e.g., HTTP requests, DNS queries) versus patterns associated with malicious activities (e.g., repeated failed login attempts).
<p><b>Introduction to Snort</b></p>
<li>Snort operates as a NIDS, analyzing network traffic in real-time to identify suspicious activities and potential threats.</li>
<li>Snort uses a signature-based detection approach where it matches network traffic against a set of predefined rules or signatures.</li>
<li>Snort's detection capabilities are driven by a set of rules that specify what network traffic should be considered suspicious.</li>
<li>When Snort detects traffic that matches a rule, it generates alerts and logs details about the potential security incident. </li>
